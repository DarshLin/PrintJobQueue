  CSPC 2430
  Version 2

  Version 1:This version is going to be very similar to the Stack.cpp
  from lab3, the same goes for the header file as it is a good basis to
  test and see where things can be changed to look like a Queue.

  Version 2: This is where most modifications will come in and I will
  attempt to make the queue go from front to back and loop around again.
  v2 result: Got too complicated, going to simplify to one variable for data
  before juggling four pieces of data
